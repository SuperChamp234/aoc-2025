# AOC 2025 Solutions by Zain :D

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges. Each day's solution is organized in its own directory, with code written in OCaml.

I also want to tackle Advent of FPGA by Jane Street, that's why OCaml, so that I can easily start with HardCaml later on.

Reach out to me if you wanna try something more fun for the Advent of FPGA Challenge on aoc@zainsv.me or twitter @zain_sv_ or @zainsv.me on BSky!
